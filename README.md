# CP

Here are my CP solutions.

Files can be worked on in the root directory. When completed, they can be archived with the `./utils/clean.sh` script.

## Hackpack

I also store in this repository all of the code to generate the hackpack I made. Any applicable programmer-defined DSA (that I understand how to use) I put in `./hackpack/`. Then the `./utils/gen_hackpack.py` script generates a pdf using latex.
