\section*{Disjoint Set Union-Find}
    The Disjoint Set Union-Find data structure efficiently manages a collection of disjoint sets. It supports two primary operations:  
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Find: Determines the representative (or root) of the set containing a specific element.
        \item Union: Merges two sets into one
    \end{enumerate}
