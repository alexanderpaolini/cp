Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a \texttt{sorted} array. 

It repeatedly divides the search range in half, reducing the time complexity to $O(log_2 n)$. 

The algorithm compares the target with the middle element, adjusting the search range based on whether the target is greater or smaller than the middle element.
