\section*{Trie}
    A \texttt{Trie} is a Data Structure that can hold lists of strings.

    It does this efficiently by modeling it as a tree, allowing overlap of characters. If a string ends at a character, the character's flag will be set to true.

    Tries support the following base operations:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Insert - Add a string to the trie
        \item Search - Check if a string is in the trie
        \item Starts With - Check if the word's characters are stored in the trie, but not necessarily flagged as a word.
    \end{enumerate}
