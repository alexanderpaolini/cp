# Hackpack

This is my personal hackpack. It isn't as complete or comprehensive as others (as I don't know enough to use the algorithms provided in others). Instead, I compiled any algorithms or data structure implementations I think will be useful.

**Format**:

Each subject has a subfolder. The `content.tex` will be rendered, then the `<name>.cpp` will be rendered. And then the subfolders of said subfolders are rendered in the same way.

## Scripts

**./gen_hackpack.py** - Generates the hackpack pdf to print for competition use.

> Usage: python ./utils/gen_hackpack.py

**./gen_snippets.py** - Generates the snippet file for VSCode.

> Usage: python ./utils/gen_snippets.py
